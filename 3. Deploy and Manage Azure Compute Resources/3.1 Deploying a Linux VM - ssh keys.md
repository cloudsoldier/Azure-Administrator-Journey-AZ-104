### Lecture Notes: Creating and Authenticating to a Linux Virtual Machine Using SSH Keys

---

#### **Objective:**
- Demonstrate how to create a Linux virtual machine (VM) in Azure.
- Authenticate to the Linux VM using SSH keys for better security.

---

#### **Step 1: Overview of SSH Keys Authentication**
- **SSH Keys**: A secure method of authentication to Linux-based systems.
  - **Public Key**: Stored on the virtual machine.
  - **Private Key**: Used to authenticate when connecting to the VM.

- Compared to password authentication, SSH keys provide a more secure and efficient way of connecting to a Linux machine.

#### **Step 2: Creating a Linux VM in Azure**
1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**:
   - Go to the **Virtual Machines** section in Azure.

2. **Start the Creation Process**:
   - Click **Create** to initiate the VM creation wizard.

3. **Configuration Settings**:
   - **Resource Group**: Select or create a new resource group for the VM.
   - **VM Name**: Provide a unique name for your virtual machine.
   - **Region**: Choose the desired region (e.g., North Europe).
   - **Availability Options**: Set to **No infrastructure redundancy required**.
   - **Image**: Select **Ubuntu Server 24.04** (or the version you need).
   - **Size**: Choose an appropriate VM size (typically the same as earlier).

4. **Authentication Method**:
   - For authentication, select **SSH public key**.
   - Enter a **username** for the VM.
   - **Generate a Key Pair**: 
     - Azure will automatically generate a new SSH key pair for authentication.
     - The **public key** will be stored on the VM, while the **private key** is kept on your local machine.

5. **Review and Create**:
   - After reviewing the configuration settings, click **Create** to deploy the VM.

#### **Step 3: Using the Private Key to Authenticate**
1. **Key Pair Generation**:
   - When the VM is being created, Azure will generate a new SSH key pair.
   - **Download the Private Key**: Ensure you download the **.pem file** (private key) to a secure location on your machine. This file will be used to authenticate into the Linux VM.

2. **Using Puttygen to Convert .pem to .ppk (for Windows Users)**:
   - **Install Putty**: Putty is a popular SSH client for Windows.
     - It comes with **Puttygen**, a tool that converts private keys into **.ppk** format, which is used by Putty.
   
   - **Open Puttygen**:
     - Load the downloaded **.pem** file (private key) into Puttygen:
       - Click **Load** and browse for the **.pem** file.
       - Once loaded, save it as a **.ppk** file (Private Key) on your local machine.
   
3. **Connecting to the Linux VM**:
   - **Use Putty**:
     - Open **Putty** and go to the **Session** tab.
     - Enter the **Public IP address** of the Linux VM (found in the Azure portal).
     - Go to the **SSH > Auth** section in Putty.
     - Browse and select the **.ppk** private key you just saved.
     - Return to the **Session** tab and click **Open** to initiate the SSH connection.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Enter the **username** you configured during the VM setup.
   - The authentication will proceed using the SSH keys, so no password is needed.

---

#### **Step 4: Final Steps**
1. **Successful Login**:
   - If the SSH connection is successful, you will be logged into the Linux VM.

2. **Close the Session**:
   - Once you're finished with the session, you can close it.

3. **Delete the VM**:
   - After completing the demo, go back to the **Azure portal**, navigate to **All Resources**, and delete the Linux VM resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

---

#### **Summary**
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - SSH keys provide a more secure method of authentication than passwords.
  - The private key is stored on your local machine, and the public key is saved on the VM.
  - The process includes generating a key pair, converting the private key to the correct format, and using tools like Putty and Puttygen for Windows users to establish an SSH connection to the Linux VM.
  
This concludes the chapter on creating and authenticating to a Linux VM in Azure using SSH keys.
