### Lab Notes: Introduction to Azure Disks for Virtual Machines

#### 1. **Overview of Azure Disks**
   - Azure disks are storage volumes used by Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).
   - When you create a VM, it gets an **OS-level disk** (operating system disk) by default, where the OS is installed.
   - Similar to physical disks on your laptop or workstation, Azure disks allow you to store data on your virtual machine.
   - **Additional disks** can be added to the VM to store applications, data, etc.
   
#### 2. **Types of Disks**
   Azure provides several disk types for different use cases. The main types are:

   - **OS Disk**: This is the disk where the operating system is installed.
   - **Data Disks**: Additional disks that can be attached to the VM for storing data, applications, or databases.
   - **Temporary Disk**: This is a disk provided for temporary storage. Its data can be lost during maintenance events, redeployment, or when the VM is stopped.

#### 3. **Temporary Disk**
   - Temporary disks are mounted on VMs, but their content is not persistent.
   - The size of the temporary disk depends on the VM size.
   - Important considerations:
     - Data on the temporary disk can be lost during maintenance or VM redeployment.
     - This disk is typically used for temporary data that does not need to be stored permanently.

#### 4. **Adding Disks to Virtual Machines**
   - When creating a VM, the OS disk is created by default.
   - Additional data disks can be added either during VM creation or after the VM is created.
   - Data disks allow you to store larger volumes of data separately from the OS disk.

#### 5. **Azure Disk Types**
   - **Premium SSD**: Offers high performance, suitable for I/O-intensive workloads.
   - **Standard SSD**: A more affordable option than Premium SSD but still offers decent performance.
   - **Standard HDD**: The least expensive option with lower throughput and IOPS, suitable for workloads that require less performance.
   - **Ultra Disk**: High-performance disks offering the best throughput and IOPS, suitable for demanding workloads, but at a higher cost.

   - **Key Differences**:
     - **Throughput**: Refers to the amount of data that can be read or written per second.
     - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**: Refers to the number of read and write operations that can be performed on the disk in one second.

#### 6. **Use Case for Disk Types**
   - **Throughput**: If your application requires high data transfer speeds (e.g., storing large video files), choose a disk with high throughput.
   - **IOPS**: For applications like databases, which require many read/write operations (e.g., querying or writing data to the database frequently), higher IOPS is needed.

#### 7. **Managing Disks in the Azure Portal**
   - To view and manage disks, navigate to the VM settings in the Azure Portal:
     - Go to the **Disks** section to view attached disks.
     - The OS disk will be listed by default, and you can also see data disks.
   - Disk properties include size, storage type (Premium SSD, Standard SSD, etc.), and performance settings.

#### 8. **Cost Considerations**
   - The cost of disks varies based on the type (e.g., Ultra Disk being the most expensive and Standard HDD being the least expensive).
   - The cost is also impacted by the disk's size and performance characteristics (throughput and IOPS).

#### 9. **Conclusion**
   - Disks in Azure are essential for storing data in virtual machines.
   - Understanding the differences between disk types and their performance characteristics can help you select the right disk for your workload.
   - In future labs, we will explore how to add and manage additional data disks and configure them for specific workloads.

#### **Next Steps**
   - In the upcoming chapters, we will learn how to work with **data disks** and explore how to attach, format, and manage them in different use cases.

###### creating vm

az vm create \
  --resource-group kashrg \
  --name kashvm01 \
  --image Win2022Datacenter \
  --size Standard_DS2_v2 \
  --admin-username azureuser \

This summary provides an overview of the Azure disk types, temporary disk considerations, and the importance of throughput and IOPS for various workloads. The subsequent chapters will focus on hands-on exercises to add and configure additional data disks for virtual machines in Azure.
